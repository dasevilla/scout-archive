  "adventure_overview": "Lots of people have great ideas: flying to the moon, tunneling under rivers, building robots that walk and talk, or making triple-loop rollercoasters. Engineers turn those ideas into reality. They use science, math, and creative thinking to improve people’s lives. In this Adventure, you will learn what engineers do. Even better, you can do some engineering projects of your own. So put on your thinking cap and get ready to think like an engineer! Prior to any activity, use Scouting America’s SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved. All participants in official Scouting America activities should become familiar with the Guide to Safe Scouting and applicable program literature or manuals.",
