  "adventure_overview": "Humans started fishing as a way to get food. Many cities and towns were established and grew because they were close to a source of fish. Today, most people fish as a hobby, releasing what they catch. Fishing gives you a chance to be outdoors near the water and have fun. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved. All participants in official Scouting America activities should become familiar with the Guide to Safe Scouting and applicable program literature or manuals.",
