  "adventure_overview": "To most people, coins are used to buy things they want or need. But coins can also tell a story. The pictures on United States coins tell a lot about our country’s culture and history. In this Adventure, you will get to be a numismatist (noo-MIZmuh-tist). A numismatist is a person who studies coins and money. You’ll learn where coins are made and the meaning of their pictures and words. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved. All participants in official Scouting America activities should become familiar with the Guide to Safe Scouting and applicable program literature or manuals.",
