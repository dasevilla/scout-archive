  "overview": "The Electronics Merit Badge is a fun, STEM-based merit badge that will inspire Scouts to pursue a possible career in Electronics. Scouts will learn about capacitors, transistors, and resistors while grasping the basic principles of digital techniques and demonstrating how to build a control device circuit. Understand the behaviors of electrons and learn safety precautions when using, building, altering, or repairing electronic devices with the Electronics Merit Badge.",
