  "name": "Welding",
  "overview": "Welding is the process of joining with a weld – joining or combining similar pieces of metal by heating them with a flame torch or an electric current, then hammering or pressing them together while they are soft. Welding plays a major role in our modern world, and mastery of the skill can lead to exciting career opportunities. Someday, you may have an opportunity to experience exciting new career paths in welding.",
