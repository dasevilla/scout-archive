  "adventure_overview": "It is important to know that Scouting America has a religious element as a part of the program as stated in the Scout Oath and Scout Law. However, Scouting America is absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward a member’s religion or faith. Scouting America policy is that the home and organization or group with which the member is connected shall give definite attention to religious life. Duty to God … Your family and religious leaders teach you about God and the ways you can serve. You can do your duty to God by following the wisdom of those teachings and by defending the rights of others to practice their own beliefs. Scouting America is absolutely nonsectarian (not affiliated with or restricted to a particular faith or religious group) Reverent means that a Scout is faithful in their religious duties and respects the beliefs of others. No matter what the religious faith of a Scout may be, this fundamental of good citizenship should be kept before them. This Adventure is commonly done at home with the Cub Scout’s family.  If it is being done as a den, ensure that every parent and guardian is aware of the content and the activities that the den will do and allow parents to opt out of doing it as a den activity and choose to complete the requirement at home.",
