- **Adventure name:** Bears Afloat
- **Rank:** Bear
- **Type:** Elective
- **Category:** 

## Overview

Adult leaders supervising activities afloat must have completed Safety Afloat training within the previous two years. Cub Scout activities afloat are limited to council, district, pack, or den events on calm or gently flowing water that do not include float trips (expeditions). Safety Afloat standards apply to the use of canoes, kayaks, rowboats, rafts, floating tubes, sailboats, motorboats (including waterskiing), and other small craft (Stand Up Paddle Boards). Grip, shaft, throat, shoulder, blade, and tip are all parts of a paddle. In this Adventure, you’ll discover the world of paddle crafts. Canoes, kayaks, and stand-up paddleboards all rely on you as the source of power. There are places that you can get to only by paddle craft. You will also learn how to be safe when using a paddle craft, from learning about your equipment to proper ways to paddle your craft.
