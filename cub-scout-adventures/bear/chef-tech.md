## Overview

Cooking is a great way to see how technology has impacted our lives. As a Cub Scout, you may cook a hot dog using a stick on an open fire, which is the same way humans have cooked with fire for thousands of years. You could also cook a hot dog by boiling it in water in a pot on a stove. The fastest way to cook a hot dog is in a microwave in a matter of seconds. In this Adventure, we will explore technology in the kitchen. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved. All participants in official Scouting America activities should become familiar with the Guide to Safe Scouting and applicable program literature or manuals.
