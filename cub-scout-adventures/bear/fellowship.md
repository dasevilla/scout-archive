## Overview

It is important to know that Scouting America has a religious element as a part of the program as stated in the Scout Oath and Scout Law. However, Scouting America is absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward a member’s religion or faith. Scouting America policy is that the home and organization or group with which the member is connected shall give definite attention to religious life. In this Adventure, you’re encouraged to learn more about your family’s faith traditions. You will complete most of these requirements at home with your family. Faith means having complete trust or confidence in someone or something. Always be respectful when talking about your faith and when learning about other faiths. This Adventure is commonly done at home with the Cub Scout’s family. If it is being done as a den, ensure that every parent and guardian is aware of the content and the activities that the den will do and allow for parents to opt out of doing it as a den activity and choose to complete the requirement at home.
