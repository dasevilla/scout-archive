  "adventure_overview": "Everywhere you go, you leave behind clues: fingerprints on your juice glass, DNA on your toothbrush, bits of fabric on your favorite chair, and footprints in your yard. Criminals leave behind clues, too. Forensic scientists study those clues to help law enforcement officers solve crimes. Forensics is all about using science to answer questions about crimes (and other things that have happened). In this Adventure, you will practice some of the skills of a forensic scientist. You will analyze a fingerprint, a footprint, the contents of ink, and some mysterious white powder. Grab your magnifying glass and start detecting!",
