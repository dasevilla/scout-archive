- **Type:** Elective

## Overview

Did you know that nearly three-fourths of the Earth is covered by water? It is! If you want to explore a lot of the world, you have to go by boat or know how to swim. Grizzly bears are animals that know how to swim even though they live in the forest. They swim in ice-cold rivers to catch the salmon they eat. As a Bear Scout, you will get to go swimming, too – not to catch fish, but to have fun. In this Adventure, you’ll learn about swimming and boating and how to stay safe around the water. This elective Adventure may be earned by completing the requirements below OR passing Scouting America swimmer test OR taking swimming lessons. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved.
