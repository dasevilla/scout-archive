## Overview

A pocketknife is a useful tool to have for Scouting activities. It can also be dangerous if you don’t use it the right way. In this Adventure, you will learn how to use a pocketknife safely. You will also get to learn the basics of carving. This Adventure is required in order for you to use any knife during a Cub Scout activity as a 3rd grade Bear.  Next year you will need to earn the Webelos Adventure, Chef’s Knife, to earn the privilege of using a knife during a Cub Scout activity as a 4th grade Webelos. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved.
