## Overview

It is important to know that Scouting America has a religious element as a part of the program as stated in the Scout Oath and Scout Law. However, Scouting America is absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward a member’s religion or faith.  Scouting America policy is that the home and organization or group with which the member is connected shall give definite attention to religious life. In this Adventure, the Tigers learn about their family by exploring the faith traditions and celebrations that make being part of their family special. Tigers may earn this Adventure by completing the requirements for the Adventure OR by earning the religious emblem of their choosing. This Adventure is commonly done at home with the Cub Scout’s family.  If it is being done as a den ensure that every parent and guardian is aware of the content and the activities that the den will do and allow for parents to opt out of doing it as a den activity and choose to complete the requirement at home.
