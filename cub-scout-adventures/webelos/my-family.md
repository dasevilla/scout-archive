## Overview

Understanding your religious beliefs and the beliefs of others can help you make sense of the world around you. This Adventure lets you learn about your own faith and family and explore ways to continue your faith practices in the future. This Adventure is commonly done at home with the Cub Scout’s family.  If it is being done as a den, ensure that every parent and guardian is aware of the content and the activities that the den will do and allow for parents to opt out of doing it as a den activity and choose to complete the requirement at home. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America’s SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved.
