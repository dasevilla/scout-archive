## Overview

You are about to go on an overnight campout. Sleeping in a tent, roasting marshmallows, and exploring nature are some of the best parts of being a Cub Scout. Before you go, make a list of what you need to bring. Your den leader and parent(s) will help you get ready. Each time you go camping, you can show you are a Wolf Scout by doing more on your own. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved. All participants in official Scouting America activities should become familiar with the Guide to Safe Scouting and applicable program literature or manuals.
