You can use the Scout Oath and the Scout Law as guides when you are playing games and sports. In this Adventure, you’ll be challenged to exercise, play a team sport with your den, and show how to be a good sport. Time to move your powerful paws. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved.",
