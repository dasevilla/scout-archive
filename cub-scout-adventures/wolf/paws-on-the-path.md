## Overview

It is time to go outside!  Every journey begins with just one step, and that first step can take you on a fun-filled adventure simply by going outside for a walk, just like the one you and your Wolf den are about to take. Where you take your walk is up to your den.  It may be a walk around the center of your city or town, it may be at a local park with a trail, or it may be a trail in a forest.  No matter where you take your walk you will see signs of nature in different forms. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved.
