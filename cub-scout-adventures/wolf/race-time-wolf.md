## Overview

This Adventure is the highlight for many Cub Scouts. The Pinewood Derby® and Raingutter Regatta™ are two popular Cub Scout races. The best part about these races is getting to design and build your own car or boat. You may want to design your car or boat for looks, or you may want to go for speed; either way, have fun spending time with your family making your car or boat or both. Prior to any activity, use Scouting America SAFE Checklist to ensure the safety of all those involved. All participants in official Scouting America activities should become familiar with the Guide to Safe Scouting and applicable program literature or manuals.
