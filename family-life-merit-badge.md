## Overview

**Eagle required**

The family is the basic unit of society and is important to both individuals and communities. The world is rapidly changing, making todayâ€™s society much more complex than ever before. As Scouts earn this merit badge, they will realize why it is important to know more about family life and how to strengthen their families.

## Requirements

* (1) Prepare an outline on what a family is and discuss this with your counselor. Tell why families are important to individuals and to society. Discuss how the actions of one member can affect other members.
* (2) List several reasons why you are important to your family and discuss this with your parent or guardian and with your counselor.
* (3) Prepare a list of your regular home duties or chores (at least five) and do them for 90 days. Keep a record of how often you do each of them. Discuss with your counselor the effect your chores had on your family.
