  "overview": "The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Merit Badge introduces Scouts to the fundamentals of AI and automation through hands-on activities and real-world examples. Scouts learn key terms, explore how AI and automation are used in daily life, school, and work, and examine ethical concerns like bias and privacy. They also investigate deepfakes, practice communicating effectively with AI, and apply their knowledge through a project or teaching activity. Finally, Scouts explore career paths in AI by researching or interviewing professionals in the field.",
