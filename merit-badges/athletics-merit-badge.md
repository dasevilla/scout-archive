## Overview



Being involved in an athletic endeavor is not only a way to have fun, but it also is one of the best ways for a person to maintain a healthy and strong body, living up to the promise each Scout makes “to keep myself physically strong.”

## Requirements

* NOTE: If meeting any of the requirements for this merit badge is against the Scout's religious convictions, the requirement does not have to be done if the Scout's parent or guardian and the proper religious advisors state in writing that to do so would be against religious convictions. The Scout's parent or guardian must also accept full responsibility for anything that might happen because of this exemption.
