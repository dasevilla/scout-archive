![Basketry Merit Badge](images/basketry-merit-badge.jpg)

## Overview



Basketry is a handy skill for a Scout. A basket can be a sturdy companion on campouts, carrying clothes snugly and efficiently, holding potatoes and corn for roasting over a campfire, or carrying the day’s fishing catch back to camp for dinner. Baskets and basket-weaving projects also make great gifts for family and friends.
