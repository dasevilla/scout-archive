## Overview



What would summer camp be without the bugle sounding “Reveille” in the morning and “Taps” in the evening? Camp and the bugle go together. The bugle is an ideal instrument for the beginning musician because most of the music uses only four notes. The ability to read music is not necessary, because the tunes are familiar and can be played ear.

## Requirements

* Note: A bugle, trumpet, or cornet may be used to meet these requirements.
* (1) Give a brief history of the bugle. Resources:  [Bugles in American History (video)](https://youtu.be/gOxuoJHPCJA?si=ir832tqvUZd-37SE)  [The Bugler's Cry - A History of Taps (video)](https://youtu.be/Z13dtuMMFps?si=GemQ1_rjJY3duaRw)

    * (b) Compose a bugle call for your troop or patrol to signal a common group activity, such as assembling for mealtime or striking a campsite. Play the call that you have composed before your unit or patrol.
