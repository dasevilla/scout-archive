![Bugling Merit Badge](images/bugling-merit-badge.jpg)

## Overview



What would summer camp be without the bugle sounding “Reveille” in the morning and “Taps” in the evening? Camp and the bugle go together. The bugle is an ideal instrument for the beginning musician because most of the music uses only four notes. The ability to read music is not necessary, because the tunes are familiar and can be played ear.

## Requirements

* NOTE: A bugle, trumpet, or cornet may be used to meet these requirements.
