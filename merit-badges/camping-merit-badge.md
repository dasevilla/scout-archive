![Camping Merit Badge](images/camping-merit-badge.jpg)

## Overview

**Eagle required**

Camping is one of the best-known methods of the Scouting movement. When he founded the Scouting movement in the early 1900s, Robert Baden-Powell encouraged every Scout to learn the art of living out-of-doors. He believed a young person able to take care of himself while camping would have the confidence to meet lifeâ€™s other challenges, too.
