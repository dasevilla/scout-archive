Each paddler must demonstrate these maneuvers in both the bow and stern and on both sides of the canoe while maintaining trim and balance of the canoe:
  - (a) Pivot (spin) the canoe 180° (half circle) to the right from a stationary position, stop, and return to the starting position by pivoting to the left using draw and pushaway strokes or using forward and reverse sweeps staying within 2 boat lengths of the starting position.
  - (b) Move a canoe sideways (abeam) in one direction for 10 feet and then return to the starting position using the draw and pushaway strokes.
  - (c) While in forward motion, stop the canoe within two boat lengths using the backstroke.
