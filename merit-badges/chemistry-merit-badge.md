![Chemistry Merit Badge](images/chemistry-merit-badge.jpg)

## Overview



Chemistry explores how substances react with each other, how they change, how certain forces connect molecules, and how molecules are made are all parts of chemistry. Stretch your imagination to envision molecules that cannot be seenâ€”but can be proven to existâ€”and you become a chemist.

## Requirements

* (1) Do the following and discuss with your counselor:
    * (a) Obtain safety data sheets (SDS) for sucrose (sugar), isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), and a waterproofing spray.

    * (b) Coat your hands with a mixture of cooking oil and a nontoxic powder, such as sand or cocoa. Wash your hands with water and observe what happens. Coat your hands again, then wash with soap and water. Discuss the differences with your counselor. Resource: [How Does Soap Work? (video)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Jx5BgbIkXEs)
    * (c) Perform an experiment to demonstrate how rubbing alcohol affects microbial growth using baker's yeast. Discuss the results with your counselor. Resource: [Watching How Alcohol Kills Viruses and Bacteria Under a Microscope (video)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Jx5BgbIkXEs)


* (3) Chemistry and Cooking. After successfully completing requirement 1, do EACH of the following:
    * (a) Perform a Maillard, or browning, reaction. Discuss with your counselor whether a physical or chemical change has occurred, and what happened to molecules in the food during the cooking process.

* (4) Chemistry and Camping. After successfully completing requirement 1, do TWO of the following:
    * (a) Design and conduct an experiment to compare at least two different types of waterproofing. Discuss with your counselor which one you would prefer to use on your tent and which one you would prefer to use on your boots, and why.
