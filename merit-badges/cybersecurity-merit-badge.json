  "overview": "The Cybersecurity Merit Badge equips Scouts with essential knowledge and skills to navigate and protect the digital world. Scouts learn about online safety, ethical behavior, cyber threats, and how to defend against them using tools like firewalls, antivirus software, and strong passwords. They explore encryption, connected devices, and the risks of public Wi-Fi, while also practicing safe habits like updating software and backing up data. Through hands-on activities, Scouts investigate real-world cyber incidents, participate in cybersecurity challenges, and explore career opportunities in the field.",
