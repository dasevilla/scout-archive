## Overview



Discover the history and importance of various kinds of exploration by earning the Exploration Merit Badge. Scouts will study real-life explorers who made their mark either in the wild or in a scientific lab, then plan, prepare and go on an expedition that could be nearby or far away.

## Requirements

* Note: As you work on the Exploration merit badge, remember to always use the buddy system. Whether you are out in the field or meeting with your counselor, having a buddy will help ensure everyone's safety. You and your buddy can watch out for each other wherever you may be or whatever you may be doing.
