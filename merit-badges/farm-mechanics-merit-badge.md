## Overview



From the mattock and hoe to the horse and mule, the cotton gin and reaper, the tractor and air seederâ€”this is the story of farm equipment. Today, most farms are mechanized and farmers can do most of their own maintenance work and make the adjustments needed on their many intricate farm implements.
