![Gardening Merit Badge](images/gardening-merit-badge.jpg)

## Overview



Humans have been growing plants for thousands of years. Farmers and horticulturists make their living growing food and other plants, while other people grow gardens for pleasure. Becoming a good gardener requires a Scout to understand the science of growing plantsâ€”how to prepare the soil, how to select and plant seeds, and how to care for the growing plants.
