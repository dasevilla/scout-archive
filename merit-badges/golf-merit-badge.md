## Overview



Golf is unique because the players police themselves. Other sports depend upon referees or umpires to apply penalties when there are infractions of the rules. In golf, every player is expected to act honorably, and the welfare and integrity of the game rely on every player’s honesty. This is why golf often is referred to as a “gentleman’s game.”

## Requirements
