![Pioneering Merit Badge](images/pioneering-merit-badge.jpg)

## Overview



Pioneering—the knowledge of ropes, knots, and splices along with the ability to build rustic structures by lashing together poles and spars—is among the oldest of Scouting’s skills. Practicing rope use and completing projects with lashings also allow Scouts to connect with past generations, ancestors who used many of these skills as they sailed the open seas and lived in America’s forests and prairies.

## Requirements

* Note: All pioneering projects constructed for this merit badge must comply with height standards as outlined in the Guide to Safe Scouting.  Counselors should also ensure that Scouts follow the Leave No Trace Seven Principles and the Outdoor Code in their pioneering projects. Just as hiking and camping without a trace are signs of expert outdoorsmanship, protecting the environment is a mark of responsible pioneering. Minimize impacts to the land.
* NOTE:  The official merit badge pamphlets are now free and downloadable  [HERE](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/Merit_Badge_ReqandRes/Pamphlets/Pioneering.pdf) or can be purchased at the [Scout Shop.](https://www.scoutshop.org/)
* (1) Do the following:
    * (a) Explain to your counselor the most likely hazards you might encounter while participating in pioneering activities and what you should do to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate, and respond to these hazards.

    * (b) Discuss the prevention of, and first-aid treatment for, injuries and conditions that could occur while working on pioneering projects, including rope splinters, rope burns, cuts, scratches, insect bites and stings, hypothermia, dehydration, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, sunburn, and falls.
