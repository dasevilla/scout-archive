- (5) **Project.** With your counselor's guidance, select three different programming languages and development environments. For each sub-requirement below, do the following: Write or modify a program using the indicated programming language and development environment. The program must take input and produce output based on computations and decisions made on the input. Debug and demonstrate the program to your counselor. Explain how each program processes inputs, makes decisions based on those inputs, and provides outputs based on computations and decision making.
  - (a) In the first language and environment, write or modify a program, debug and demonstrate, and explain as above.
  - (b) In the second language and environment, write or modify a program, debug and demonstrate, and explain as above.

    **Resources:** [Programming Merit Badge Welcome! From AutomationDirect (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s07aEbPwThM)
  - (c) In the third language and environment, write or modify a program, debug and demonstrate, and explain as above.

    **Resources:** [Codedex / Start Your Coding Adventure (website)](https://www.codedex.io/)

- (6) **Careers.** Do ONE of the following:
  - (a) Explore careers related to this merit badge. Research one career to learn about the training and education needed, costs, job prospects, salary, job duties, and career advancement. Your research methods may include—with your parent or guardian's permission—an internet or library search, an interview with a professional in the field, or a visit to a location where people in this career work. Discuss with your counselor both your findings and what about this profession might make it an interesting career.
  - (b) Explore how you could use knowledge and skills from this merit badge to pursue a hobby or healthy lifestyle. Research any training needed, expenses, and organizations that promote or support it. Discuss with your counselor what short-term and long-term goals you might have if you pursued this.
