* (5) Project. With your counselor's guidance, select three different programming languages and development environments.  For each sub-requirement below, do the following: Write or modify a program using the indicated programming language and development environment.  The program must take input and produce output based on computations and decisions made on the input.  Debug and demonstrate the program to your counselor.  Explain how each program processes inputs, makes decisions based on those inputs, and provides outputs based on computations and decision making.
    * (a) In the first language and environment, write or modify a program, debug and demonstrate, and explain as above.
    * (b) In the second language and environment, write or modify a program, debug and demonstrate, and explain as above. Resource: [Programming Merit Badge Welcome! From AutomationDirect (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s07aEbPwThM)
    * (c) In the third language and environment, write or modify a program, debug and demonstrate, and explain as above. Resource: [Codedex / Start Your Coding Adventure (website)](https://www.codedex.io/)


* (6) Careers. Find out about three career opportunities that require knowledge in  programming. Pick one and find out the education, training, and experience required. Discuss this with your counselor and explain why this career might be of interest to you.
