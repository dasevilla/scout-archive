## Overview



Radio is a way to send information, or communications, from one place to another. Broadcasting includes both one-way radio (a person hears the information but can¹t reply) as well as two-way radio (where the same person can both receive and send messages).

  - (a) Do the following:
  - (1) Draw a chart of the electromagnetic spectrum covering 300 kilohertz (kHz) to 3,000 Megahertz (MHz).

  - (c) Explain how cell phones keep the correct time and show locations and elevations.
  - (d) Explain the benefits and limitations of cell phones in emergencies.
  - (e) Explain wireless charging for cell phones and other devices.

- (8) **Amateur and Professional Radio.** Do ONE of the following options:
  - **Option A—Amateur Radio.** Do ALL of the following:
  - (1) Tell why the FCC has an amateur radio service. Describe activities that amateur radio operators can do on the air, once they have earned an amateur radio license.
  - (2) Explain differences between the Technician, General, and Extra Class license requirements and privileges. Explain who administers amateur radio exams.
  - (3) Explain at least five Q signals or amateur radio terms.
  - (4) Explain how you would make an emergency call on voice or Morse code.
  - (5) Explain the differences between handheld, mobile, and base station transceivers and their uses. Explain the use of amateur radio repeaters.
  - (6) Using proper call signs, Q signals, and abbreviations, carry on a 10-minute real or simulated amateur radio contact using voice, Morse code, or digital mode. Properly log the real or simulated amateur radio contact, and record the signal report.
    **Note:** Licensed amateur radio operators may substitute five QSL cards as evidence of contacts with five amateur radio operators.
  - **Option B—Radio Broadcasting.** Do ALL of the following:
  - (1) Discuss with your counselor FCC broadcast regulations. Include power levels, frequencies, and the regulations for low-power stations.
  - (2) Prepare a program schedule for radio station "KBSA" of exactly one-half hour, including music, news, commercials, and proper station identification. Record your program on audiotape or in a digital audio format, using proper techniques.
  - (3) Listen to and properly log 15 broadcast stations. Determine the program format and target audience for five of these stations.
  - (4) Explain to your counselor at least eight terms used in commercial broadcasting, such as segue, cut, fade, continuity, remote, Emergency Alert System, network, cue, dead air, PSA, and playlist.
