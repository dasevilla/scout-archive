## Overview



This merit badge introduces Scouts to sculpture, an art form that allows an artist to express what he sees and feels by using these three dimensions by shaping materials such as clay, stone, metal, and wood.

## Requirements

- (1) Explain to your counselor the precautions that must be followed for the safe use and operation of a sculptor's tools, equipment, and other materials.

- (2) Do TWO of the following:
  - (a) Model in clay a life-size human head. Then sculpt in modeling clay, carve in wood or plaster, or use 3D modeling software to make a small-scale model of an animal or person. Explain to your counselor the method and tools you used to sculpt the figure.
