# Search and Rescue Merit Badge
![Search and Rescue Merit Badge](images/search-and-rescue-merit-badge.jpg)

## Overview



A search is an emergency situation requiring a team of trained searchers to locate a missing person. A rescue is an emergency situation where a person’s location is known – perhaps having just been found by searchers – and he or she must be removed from danger and returned to safety. By working on the Search and Rescue merit badge, you will learn and practice many skills that may someday save a life.
