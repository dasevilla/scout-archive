![Multisport Merit Badge](images/multisport-merit-badge.jpg)

## Overview



Multisport is a racing competition that includes any combination of running, biking, or swimming. This badge serves as a natural progression for Scouts who are interested in or have earned individual badges for Swimming, Cycling, Athletics, or Personal Fitness. For Scouts active in one of these sports, it provides a fun opportunity to expand into another fitness area and enjoy the benefits of cross-training. Scouts proficient in two sports can discover new ways to combine their skills, which offers both immediate and long-term benefits for well-being, personal growth, and athletic endeavors.
